<h1 class="h1">About this app</h1>
<p>
    This is a <a class="anchor" href="https://kit.svelte.dev" target="_blank">SvelteKit</a> app
    (created via <a class="anchor" href="https://skeleton.dev" target="_blank">Skeleton</a>). You
    can make your own by typing the following into your command line and following the prompts:
</p>
<pre>npm create skeleton-app@latest</pre>
<p>Or, for a more "vanilla" SvelteKit experience:</p>
<pre>npm create svelte@latest</pre>
<p>
    The page you're looking at is purely static HTML, with no client-side interactivity needed.
    Because of that, we don't need to load any JavaScript. Try viewing the page's source, or opening
    the devtools network panel and reloading.
